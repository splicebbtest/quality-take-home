# A top level notification parent toggle off, should toggle all their children off.

*As a user, I can go to my notification settings and toggle all notifications off by unchecking the top level 'From <type>' check box.*

# Account deletion blocked until the user enters text in the username field.

*As a user, I am unable to delete my account until I have entered my user name in the user name field shown to me in the warning modal.*

**I think this can be improved. Currently, if I enter any text what so ever, the delete button becomes clickable. An error does show up in a alert flash next to the modal, or underneath of it depending on the screen size, when the user enters any text,  but this is an unecessary condition. The button should only become active if, and only if, the user has entered their exact username.

# Typo exists in alert flash message when creating a collection with a duplicate name.

*As a user, when I create a collection with an existing name on my studio page, I see an alert flash telling me that I can not add the set.*

**However, there is a typo in the alert message. Currently it says "Sorry, we could not create the settest. ..." "Settest" runs together and I would suggest for consistency, it not be named 'Set', but 'Collection'. So it should actually read as. "Sorry, we could not create the collection test." Also, the error is unclear as to why it failed. It does not indicate that I can not create a collection with a duplicate name. It just says I can not and should contact support. It should clearly say it has failed because a collection already exists by that name.**

**Additionally, I do not see how I can delete existing sets. If this functionality does exist, it is not obvious, but with the short time I poked around, it does not look possible.**
